        <h2>The Founders</h2>
        <figure><img src="coastalrootsfounders.jpg" alt="Jack and Madison Bronson, the original founders of Coastal Roots Nursery "></figure>
        <p>Coastal Roots Nursery has been a hidden gem of San Luis Obispo for local green thumbs since 1958. It was started by a young couple, Jack and Madison Bronson. They fostered a beautiful personal garden and grove that they would share with their neighbors. Once they realized the potential of the "fruits" of their labor and their loved-ones encouraged them to start charging for their hard work, they finally decided to make it legit. As a family-owned small business, it is important to the owners to sustain their founding values while still continuing to grow in this beautiful community of SLO they have found themselves apart of.
