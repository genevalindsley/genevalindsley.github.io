      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Cherry Wonder Tattoos</p>
      <!--Change it to the name of the company-->
      <p>Cherry Wonder Tattoos is a small women and LGBTQ+ owned tattoo shop located in the heart of Portland. It has a very bright and almost child-like aesthetic. There are four tattoo artists currently employed there. They have the mission to push gender stereotypes in the male-dominated field of tattooing. Their main values include artistic expression, creation, and breaking norms. </p>
      <!--Short description of the company-->
      <h2>Target audience</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this site are those interested in learning more about Cherry Wonder Tattoos's shop, values, events, artists, and FAQs. It is also a safe space for other women and LGBTQ+ folks and strives to have a diverse audience to reflect that. If someone comes across a tattoo artist's art on instagram who works here, they can go to Cherry Wonder Tattoo's site to get information about the location of the shop, and potentially get in contact with the artist to book an appointment. </p>
      <!-- Who are the people who use this site? -->
      <p>The primary tasks and goals of the audience could be a multitude of things. It could be to browse the diferent artists' work and see what style they like. It could also be to get basic information on the shop, like its location or phone number. Another possibility would be to get in contact with one of the artists there to book an appointment. They would likely visit this site specifically because they enjoy the art or aesthetic of the artists or shop and want to learn more. This exposure could've been through physically seeing the shop or social media posts. </p>
